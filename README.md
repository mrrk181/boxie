# Boxie - Push your files.

If you want to exchange some files  
between your computer and your smartphone,  
this is the tool for you.  

Upload your files on your computer  
and scan the QR code on your smartphone.  
Supports HTTP Basic Authentication.

## Setup & Run

Please change the username and password in `index.js`.

    $ git clone https://github.com/samuelantonioli/boxie.git && cd boxie
    $ npm install
    # Run
    $ npm start

## Why?

I normally use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`  
to transfer some files,  
but unfortunately there are many people  
who don't have a Mac or Linux.  

In those cases I have to fall back to  
WhatsApp Web. If I want to transfer  
files with sensitive information,  
I hesitate to upload it to servers  
I don't control.
